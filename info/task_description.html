<p>
    Nicola has built a simple robot for painting of the wall. The wall is marked each meter.
    The robot has a list of painting operations.
    Each operation describe which part of wall to paint as range from where to where inclusively.
    For example: the operation [1, 5] means to paint the part from 1 to 5 meter inclusively and 5 meters of the wall
    will be painted.
    Operations are executed in the order as they placed in the list of operations.
    If ranges for various operations are overlapped, then <b>they must be counted only once.</b><br>
</p>
<p>
    Stephan prepared a list of operations, but we want to check it before execution.
    You are given how many meters of the walls should be painted (the painted zone can be separated by non painted parts).
    Also you know the list of operations.
    You should to find the minimal quantity of operations from the list to paint the required length of the wall.
    If it's impossible, then return -1.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. The required length of the wall that should be painted, as integer.
    The second is a list of the operations that contain range (inclusive) as a list of two integers.<br>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The minimal number of operation. If you cannot paint enough range with the given operations,
    return -1.
